✅ Steps (Prime Program)

Take input from the user

User enters numbers separated by space.

Convert the input into a list of integers

numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))

Create an empty list to store prime numbers

primes = []

numbers = list(map(int, input("Enter numbers separated by space: ").split()))

primes = []

for num in numbers:
    if num > 1:
        for i in range(2, num):
            if num % i == 0:
                break
        else:
            primes.append(num)

print("Prime numbers are:", primes)



Loop through each number in the list

for num in numbers:

Check if the number is greater than 1

Because prime numbers start from 2.

Check if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to (num-1)

If divisible → it is not prime → stop checking further.

If not divisible by any number

Then it is a prime number.

Add it to the primes list.

After checking all numbers

Print the list of prime numbers.

✔️ Final Output

Displays all prime numbers from the entered list.
